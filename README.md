# MachineLearningVoter
Uses 3 Supervised and 2 Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms to parse through 2 voter files and either predict a vote or generate clusters

The 3 Supervised algorithms include K-Nearest Neighbor, Perceptron and ID3 Decision Tree. 
The 2 Unsupervised algorithms include K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering (AGNES).

The supervised algorithms were designed specifically for the parsing of the voter training data. 
Because there were 9 different attributes and 1 label in the data, the data was simply parsed into different variables.
